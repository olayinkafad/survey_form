# Teacher Survey form
Welcome to my first HTML and CSS project! This repository contains a simple teacher survey form. This project is my very first project to demonstrate basic web development skills using HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview
The Teacher Survey Form is designed to collect feedback from teachers on various aspects of their teaching experience and environment. The form includes various input fields such as text boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, text area and a submit button, all styled to create a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The form is designed to be responsive and works well on different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **User-Friendly Layout**: Clear and concise layout with properly labeled fields for easy navigation and input.
- **Form Validation**: Basic validation to ensure that required fields are filled out before submission.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: The structure of the form is created using HTML5, including a variety of input types and elements.
- **CSS**: The styling is applied using CSS3 to enhance the visual appearance and layout of the form.
